# Data-Visualization

The repo is to test differnt data-visulization library. The template codes are to generate interactive data exploration and 
visulisation both in python and javascript library.

Feel free to use the codes for your projects, tests and developments. 

# Visualization Toolkits

A variety of useful toolkits have been designed to help support information visualization applications. Some include support for the full visualization pipeline from data to interactive graphics, while others focus only on a subset, typically graphics and interaction.

- [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) - A JavaScript library for data-driven DOM manipulation, interaction and animation. Includes utilities for visualization techniques and SVG generation.

- [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) - A declarative language for representing visualizations. Vega will parse a visualization specification to produce a JavaScript-based visualization, using either HTML Canvas or SVG rendering. Vega is particularly useful for creating programs that produce visualizations as output.

- [Processing or p5.js](http://p5js.org/) - A popular Java-like graphics and interaction language and IDE. Processing has a strong user community with many examples. p5.js is a sister project for JavaScript.

- [Protovis](http://protovis.org/) - JavaScript visualization language, predecessor of d3.
HTML/JavaScript/XML - use standard web technologies to build the visualization. You may use libraries such as [jQuery and the](jquery.com) [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to help build your visualization.

- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) â€“ a popular open-source mapping library

- [Flare](http://flare.prefuse.org/) - Visualization toolkit for Adobe Flash

- [Prefuse](http://prefuse.org/) - Visualization toolkit for Java

- [Improvise](http://www.cs.ou.edu/~weaver/improvise/) - Java system supporting coordinated views

- [InfoVis Toolkit](http://www.cs.ou.edu/~weaver/improvise/) - A Java visualization library, from INRIA France

- [Piccolo](http://www.piccolo2d.org/) - A Java library for zoomable UIs, from U. Maryland (Java and .NET)

- [VTK](http://www.vtk.org/) - A scientific visualization library (C++ with wrappers for other languages)
